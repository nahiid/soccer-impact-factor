Project Overview
This project aims to evaluate the impact of soccer passes made by individual players and the team as a whole using the Metrica Sports dataset. The primary objective is to calculate an "impact factor" for each pass, which will help in assessing the effectiveness of passes. The impact factor will be a numeric value. Additionally, this project involves choosing Game 2 of one of the three matches from the dataset.

Why is this Metric Interesting?
The impact factor provides a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of soccer passes, allowing coaches and analysts to understand how well players and teams perform in outplaying opposing players. This information is crucial for strategic decision-making and player evaluation.
